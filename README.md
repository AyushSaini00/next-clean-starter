# Next Clean Starter

My go-to project starter template for Next.js apps. Inspired by [my portfolio](https://ayushsaini.com)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

First, run the following command to create a new project:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-app -e https://github.com/AyushSaini00/next-clean-starter
# or
yarn create next-app my-app -e https://github.com/AyushSaini00/next-clean-starter
```

After the installation of the project, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to spin up the development server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
