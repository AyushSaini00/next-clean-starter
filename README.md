## 👓 Preview

Preview it on [stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/AyushSaini00/next-clean-starter) without installing anything locally.

## 🚀 Getting Started

First, run the following command to create a new project:

```

After the installation of the project, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to spin up the development server
